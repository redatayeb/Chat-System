# 💬 Java Thymeleaf Chat System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a real-time chat system built using **Java** and **Thymeleaf**, designed to demonstrate modern backend and frontend integration using server-side rendering. The application allows users to send and receive messages through a clean and interactive web interface.

The main goal of this project was to strengthen my skills in **Java backend development**, **web architecture**, and **full-stack integration** while applying clean code principles and best practices.
